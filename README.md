# Music App
This was a UI implementation of [Dribble Design](https://dribbble.com/shots/11019630-Music-Player-Web-Application/attachments/2613913?mode=media) by designer [Emmanuel Ikechukwu](https://dribbble.com/ema_ike). The goal of this project was for me to recreate the design from scratch with no UI framework (Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc) and with no specs or design files.
